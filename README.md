# ☕ Coffee Machine – C Console Application

A simple yet well-structured **C console application** that simulates a coffee machine.  
This project focuses on **input validation**, **control flow**, and **clean user interaction** using standard C libraries.

---

## 🚀 Overview
The program allows users to:
- Select a coffee type
- Choose the number of sugar cubes
- Receive clear feedback with validated input handling

This project demonstrates solid fundamentals in **C programming** and defensive coding practices.

---

## ✨ Features
- Coffee selection using character input:
  - Latte (L)
  - Cappuccino (C)
  - Espresso (E)
  - Americano (A)
- Case-insensitive input handling using `toupper()`
- Strong input validation:
  - Rejects invalid coffee types
  - Rejects non-numeric sugar input
  - Rejects negative values
- Clean and readable console output

---

## 🧠 Technical Skills Demonstrated
- C Programming
- Input validation with `scanf`
- Loop control (`while`)
- Conditional logic (`if / else`)
- Buffer handling
- Standard libraries: `<stdio.h>`, `<ctype.h>`
